== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you guarantee that the traffic will increase? =
Quite honestly - no one can give you a guarantee that your traffic will increase. If anyone does, they have an agenda, and you should stay as far away from them as possible.

SEO is an ever-changing game, and what works today might not work tomorrow. With that said, we do guarantee that our plugin is the best SEO plugin there is, and it gives you the best chance of ranking higher in Google than any other SEO plugin available right now.


= Can I transfer my SEO & Redirection settings from another plugin to Rank Math? =
Absolutely. Rank Math has a built-in feature to import SEO settings from the most popular SEO plugins like Yoast SEO, Yoast SEO Premium, AIO SEO Pack, All In One Schema Rich Snippets, and Redirection. Once you install Rank Math and run the setup wizard, you'll see a dedicated step where you'll get to import all your SEO settings to Rank Math.

= What themes does Rank Math support? =
Rank Math has been tested with many WordPress themes and supports all major WordPress themes. Since we follow WordPress' plugin development guidelines, you can rest assured that Rank Math will work perfectly, no matter what theme you use. If you've installed Rank Math and are facing issues, it might not be because of theme incompatibility. Please get in touch with the support team by opening a support ticket in our support forum, and we will fix it for you.

= What plugins is Rank Math compatible with? =
Rank Math has been designed using WordPress' strict plugin development guidelines and therefore, is compatible with the majority of plugins. However, if you use another SEO plugin that performs any of the functions that Rank Math does, then you might get unexpected results. We recommend that you disable or delete other SEO plugins for best results.

= Will my website slow down if I Install Rank Math? =
No. Rank Math's code has been created and optimized for maximum performance. That is why using Rank Math on your website will not slow down your website. On the contrary, there is a good chance that your website will perform better than ever with Rank Math, as it does the job of multiple plugins. Once you remove the unnecessary plugins from your website, your website's performance is sure to get better.

= Is creating a Rank Math account needed to use the plugin? =
Absolutely not. Creating a FREE Rank Math account is needed only to utilize our API via which one can get automatic keyword suggestions from Google and can run SEO Site Analysis inside WordPress. <a href="https://rankmath.com/kb/free-account-benefits/" target="_blank">You can read more about that here.</a>

= Will you set up Rank Math on my website? =
Rank Math is pretty easy to set up on your website. Apart from detailed instructions on how to install Rank Math on our website, we've built in a user-friendly setup wizard that will help you set up and configure Rank Math perfectly for your website. If you face any issues even after using the setup wizard, please get in touch with the support team by sending an email to support@rankmath.com

= Do I have to remove other SEO plugins if I install Rank Math? =
That is recommended. Rank Math is designed to be an all-in-one SEO plugin that takes care of everything SEO-related. If you use other SEO plugins with Rank Math on your website, not only will the performance of your website be negatively affected, but both plugins working together can produce unexpected SEO results.

= I already use an SEO plugin. Can I use Rank Math on top of that plugin? =
You can, but we do not recommend it. Rank Math has all the functionalities that you would need in an SEO plugin. If you still prefer using another plugin for a specific feature, you can do that. But, we would recommend that you turn off that functionality of Rank Math to avoid potential conflicts/issues.

= Will I lose my rankings if I switch to Rank Math? =
No, you won't. When you install Rank Math, it will seamlessly import your settings from your current SEO plugin. Once the process is complete, the search engines won't even notice a change on your website.

If you set up Rank Math from scratch, then your search engine rankings will depend on how you configure it. But please be advised that Google and other search engines prefer good, useful content over anything else.

= What are the technical requirements for using Rank Math? =
Rank Math requires at least PHP 7.2, cURL lib, cron jobs, to be installed and enabled on the server. Those things are mostly installed on every good hosting server. When you initiate Rank Math's setup process, Rank Math will also perform a compatibility check to confirm if your server can run Rank Math. If your server has a lower configuration of any Software, please ask your hosting to update it to the latest version.

= Can I use Rank Math on a WordPress.com website? =
Yes, as the plugin is provided through WordPress.org, it is available on WordPress.com as well. However, you might be required to opt for the Business plan of WordPress.com

= Which Schema type is best for coupon websites? =
Thereâ€™s no real Schema Markup designed specifically for separate discount codes. We would suggest not to use any Schema Markup and choose the â€˜Noneâ€™ option for coupon codes because not doing so might get your site penalized.

= Why are my images not getting indexed? =
It is completely normal for Google not to index your submitted images. Sometimes, not even a single submitted image is indexed by Google.

Google is almost never willing to index all the pages and images available on a site. The number of pages and images that get indexed is based on the site's reputation and the quality of the content among others.

= How do I noindex inner paginated posts of a website? =

Rank Math makes it extremely simple and easy to NoIndex the paginated seriesâ€™ of your homepage, archives, or single posts.

Head over to WordPress Dashboard > Rank Math > Titles & Meta > Misc. Pages.

Scroll down a bit and you will see the `NoIndex Paginated Pages` option.

Enable it and you are good to good. Here is a screenshot for reference: https://i.rankmath.com/xPTxfq

Now, your paginated pages like `/page/2` etc. will no longer appear in Search Engines.

= The tag "rel=canonical" appears more than once in the document =
That must be coming from the theme's code or some other SEO/AMP plugin as the Rank Math plugin adds only one canonical URL per page.

You should try disabling all other plugins and/or switch to a different theme and check.

= What's the difference between various Schema tags? =
There are mainly two types of Schema entities, Article and BlogPosting. Article Schema is mainly used for articles as the name suggests. It can also be used for pieces of investigative reports, newspaper articles, magazine articles, research papers, etc.

On the contrary, BlogPosting Schema is used for blog posts. They can be personal or commercial in nature. Most of the non-professional blogs you see online use this Schema type.

= Why is Google not showing the Schema data? =
For the Rich Snippet data, Rank Math plugin adds the necessary markup for rich snippets. It may take some time before they show up in the search results. Please allow a few days for Google to pick up the new information.

Google WILL NOT necessarily show the Schema data though. They check a few things first and may choose not to show your rich schema. For instance, they check the overall quality of the site, and if the Schema content is representative of the main content of the page or not.

Here is a quote from one of Google's help articles:
`We perform algorithmic and manual quality checks to ensure that structured data meets relevancy standards. In cases where we see structured data that does not comply with these standards, we reserve the right to disable rich snippets for a site in order to maintain a high-quality search experience for our users. Read our webmaster guidelines for more details.`

= Why is the Carousel or Data Highlighter Not Working? =
Google can actually extract content from your pages and display it as a rich carousel (AMP or not).

But to make it easier, the best you can do is to use the Data Highlighter option in your Search Appearance tab in Webmaster Tools for your important pages (especially the pillar posts) but not on all content types. Rank Math makes it extremely convenient to do so.

= How to enter Meta Keywords in the plugin? =
Google does not use the keyword meta tag in web ranking. Here's a video supporting that:
https://youtu.be/jK7IPbnmvVU
Bing also mentioned the following statement
Today, it's pretty clear the meta keyword tag is dead in terms of SEO value. Sure, it might have value for contextual ad systems or serve as a signal to bots plying the web looking for topics to target, but as far as search goes, that tag flatlined years ago as a booster.

Because of these reasons, we do not have an option to add Meta Keywords to your posts. But, this is for your benefit as it has absolutely no effect on your SERPs or SERP rankings.

= Why am I getting a 'Not Found' Error on my Sitemaps? =
