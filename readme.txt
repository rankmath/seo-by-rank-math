= What themes does Rank Math support? =
Rank Math has been tested with many WordPress themes and supports all major WordPress themes. Since we follow WordPress plugin development guidelines, you can rest assured that Rank Math will work perfectly, no matter your theme. If you've installed Rank Math and are facing issues, it might not be because of theme incompatibility. Please contact the support team by opening a support ticket in our support forum, and we will fix it for you.

= What plugins is Rank Math compatible with? =
Rank Math has been designed using WordPress' strict plugin development guidelines and, therefore, is compatible with most plugins. However, you might get unexpected results if you use another SEO plugin that performs any of the functions that Rank Math does. We recommend that you disable or delete other SEO plugins for best results.

= Will my website slow down if I Install Rank Math? =
No. Rank Math's code has been created and optimized for maximum performance. That is why using Rank Math on your website will not slow down your website. On the contrary, your website will perform better than ever with Rank Math, as it does the job of multiple plugins. Once you remove the unnecessary plugins from your website, your website's performance is sure to get better.

= Is creating a Rank Math account needed to use the plugin? =
Not at all. Creating a FREE Rank Math account is needed only to utilize our API, which allows you get automatic keyword suggestions from Google and run SEO Site Analysis inside WordPress. <a href="https://rankmath.com/kb/free-account-benefits/" target="_blank">You can read more about that here.</a>

= Will you set up Rank Math on my website? =
Rank Math is pretty easy to set up on your website. Apart from detailed instructions on installing Rank Math on our website, we've built a user-friendly setup wizard that will help you set up and configure Rank Math ideally for your website. If you face any issues even after using the setup wizard, please get in touch with the support team by sending an email to support@rankmath.com

= Do I have to remove other SEO plugins if I install Rank Math? =
That is recommended. Rank Math is designed to be an all-in-one SEO plugin that handles everything SEO-related. If you use other SEO plugins with Rank Math on your website, not only will the performance of your website be negatively affected, but both plugins working together can produce unexpected SEO results.

= I already use an SEO plugin. Can I use Rank Math on top of that plugin? =
You can, but we do not recommend it. Rank Math has all the functionalities you need in an SEO plugin. You can do that if you still prefer using another plugin for a specific feature. However, we recommend that you turn off that functionality of Rank Math to avoid potential conflicts/issues.

= Will I lose my rankings if I switch to Rank Math? =
No, you won't. When you install Rank Math, it will seamlessly import your settings from your current SEO plugin. Once the process is complete, the search engines won't notice a change on your website.

If you set up Rank Math from scratch, your search engine rankings will depend on how you configure it. But please be advised that Google and other search engines prefer good, helpful content over anything else.

= Can I use Rank Math on a WordPress.com website? =
Yes, as the plugin is provided through WordPress.org, it is available on WordPress.com as well. However, you might be required to opt for the business plan on WordPress.com.

Google is almost never willing to index all the pages and images available on a site. The number of pages and images that get indexed is based on the site's reputation and the quality of the content, among others.

= I have further questions; how do I contact you? =
Please drop us an email at support@rankmath.com, and we will be more than happy to assist you.
